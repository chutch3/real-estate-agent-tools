Generate an Instagram post for a real estate agent about a property with the following details:
Address: "{{ formatted_address }}"
Property Type: "{{ property_type }}"
Bedrooms: "{{ bedrooms }}"
Bathrooms: "{{ bathrooms }}"
Square Footage: "{{ square_footage }}"
Lot Size: "{{ lot_size }}"
Year Built: "{{ year_built }}"
City: "{{ city }}"
State: "{{ state }}"
Zip Code: "{{ zip_code }}"
County: "{{ county }}"
Features: "{{ features }}"
Agent Name: "{{ agent_name }}"
Agent Company: "{{ agent_company }}"
Agent Contact: "{{ agent_contact }}"

The post should:
1. Start with an attention-grabbing headline about the property
2. List key features of the home, including bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage
3. Highlight any special features or amenities (e.g., pool, basement, garage)
4. Use appropriate emojis for each feature
5. Sound enthusiastic and professional like a real estate agent
6. Include a call to action (e.g., "Reach out if you have any questions")
7. End with the agent's name and contact information
8. Be within 150 words
9. Ignore any details that are not provided

Format the post similar to this example but exclude missing data points:
```

This home truly has it all:

🛏️ [Number] Bedrooms
🛁 [Number] Bathrooms
